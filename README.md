## Overview 

This build was created to push a website design I had created in my WGU UX Design class into a web development phase. 

The premise of the project is to create an updated tourist information website for the fictional island of Taniti. It is a multi-page website that allows users to explore the islands entertainment options, transportation, and lodging. The visual sitemap, lo-fi wireframe, and hi-fi wireframe were all created using Figma.
